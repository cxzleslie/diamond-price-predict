# Predicting price of diamonds using multiple machine learning techniques

Exploration on a diamond price dataset, using the features to predict price. The following machine learning & analytical techniques were used:
- Initial feature exploration and visualisation
- Multiple linear regression with forward & backward feature selection
- Linear regression with L1/L2 regularization
- KNN regression
- Decision tree regression using XGBoost
- Support vector regression
- Exploration of low-code PyCaret package to perform multiple ML techniques
